    tools: "Cursor AI, Poetry (virtual environment), Windows"
  user_level: "Coding beginner (basic Python knowledge only)"
  role:
    assistant: "Provide high-level code as a coding expert, with comments and examples for beginner understanding"
  guidelines:
    - "Respond concisely, divided into sections for readability"
    - "Provide full code or specific file/location for modifications (default for coding beginners)"
    - "Check for existing files with similar functionality before creating new files, guide file searching"
    - "Reflect Korean labor/tax laws (2025 standards) in code"
    - "Avoid using tools (e.g., X analysis, image generation) unless explicitly requested"

conversation_flow:
  start: "Request for payroll, income tax, and allowance calculation logic with attendance.csv and tax_table_2024.json, based on Korean labor/tax laws (2025)"
  updates:
    - "User uploaded YAML file and requested review"
    - "User asked to analyze why Home.js navbar differs from other files and investigate a runtime error in Home.js"
    - "User requested updating YAML with prior conversation details for continuity in future sessions"

initial_code_provided:
  - "insurance_calculator.py: Insurance and tax calculations"
  - "run_server.py: Flask backend for employee/attendance/payroll APIs"
  - "PayrollPayment.js: Frontend payroll management page"

recent_progress:
  - "Resolved backend and frontend issues (CORS, data loading, JSON parsing, TypeScript errors)"
  - "Modularized design elements (theme.js, styles.js, StyledComponents.js) for PayrollManagement.js, PayrollPayment.js, and PayrollAnalysis.js"
  - "Applied light theme design based on squareup.com/us/en/payroll, including white background, dark text (#333333), and blue accents (#007bff)"
  - "Replaced GlobalTabs with GlobalNavigation (Drawer-based navigation) for better page navigation, maintaining functionality"
  - "Analyzed Home.js navbar design difference: Home.js uses outdated GlobalTabs while others use GlobalNavigation"

issues_and_solutions:
  - "CardActions Not Defined in PayrollManagement.js":
      problem: "Browser error 'CardActions is not defined' when accessing /payroll"
      solution: "Added import { CardActions } from '@mui/material' to PayrollManagement.js"
      files_modified: "PayrollManagement.js"
  - "JSX Closing Tag Errors in PayrollAnalysis.js":
      problem: "SyntaxError and TypeScript errors due to missing </Grid> tags"
      solution: "Added missing </Grid> tags and fixed JSX structure in PayrollAnalysis.js"
      files_modified: "PayrollAnalysis.js"
  - "Dark Theme Discomfort":
      problem: "User disliked dark theme background, requested light theme"
      solution: "Changed theme.js, styles.js, and StyledComponents.js to light theme (white background #FFFFFF, dark text #333333)"
      files_modified: ["theme.js", "styles.js", "StyledComponents.js"]
  - "Font Color Visibility in StyledCard":
      problem: "Font color in StyledCard was same as background (white), making text invisible"
      solution: "Updated StyledCard in StyledComponents.js to use dark text (#333333) for visibility on white background"
      files_modified: "StyledComponents.js"
  - "Home.js Runtime Error":
      problem: "Uncaught runtime error: 'Element type is invalid' due to improper GlobalTabs import"
      solution: "Suggested verifying GlobalTabs.js export (should be default export) or replacing with GlobalNavigation for consistency"
      files_modified: "src/pages/Home.js (pending user confirmation)"
